# Bevy 52-card Pickup

Its the classic game, "52 card pickup."
A deck of cards is scattered on the ground, and you pick them all up.

## Why

This is an experiment really.
I used a free [asset pack of hand-drawn cards][card-assets-link] to render 3D cards.
The real challenges here are placement and animation.

## Try it

<https://2bndy5.github.io/bevy-52-card-pickup>.
